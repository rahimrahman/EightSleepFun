This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

##

## 1. Getting Started / Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:rahimrahman/EightSleepFun.git

cd EightSleepFun

yarn

cd ios

bundle exec pod install

cd ..
```

## 2. Start metro

```
yarn start
```

## 3. Running the Application (in different terminal)

For iOS:

```
yarn ios
```

For Android:

```
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Running unit test:

```
yarn test
```

## Running E2E (coming soon)

```
maestro test ./.maestro
```

## What's next

- [ ] Unit tests (get higher coverage)
- [ ] Maestro E2E
- [ ] Sleep Score Card
- [ ] Toss and Turn Card
- [ ] Toss and Turn Overlay
